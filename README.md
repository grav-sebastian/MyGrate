# MyGration™

## Overview

MyGration™ is a MySQL transport script written in Bash to assist with migrating data between two systems. At its core, it's a pretty simple concept many of us are already familiar with. The issue is that manually doing this is inefficient, and time consuming. This script aims to provide a flexible way to semi-automate a lot of the mundane tediousness you already encounter in your day-to-day.

This started out as a self-used solution where everything was local to my machine. It had hard-coded variables of information that I'm now rewriting to streamline this a bit more for others' use.

Coming soon.
